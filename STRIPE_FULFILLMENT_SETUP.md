# Stripe Payment & Fulfillment System Setup

This document outlines the enhanced Stripe integration with customer receipts, clean metadata structure, and order fulfillment tracking.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Payment Intent Creation
- **Clean Metadata Structure**: Individual key-value pairs instead of JSON strings
- **Automatic Customer Receipts**: `receipt_email` field enables Stripe's built-in receipt system
- **Structured Order Data**: Organized metadata for easy access and reporting

### 2. Order Fulfillment System
- **Webhook Handler**: Processes payment events and updates fulfillment status
- **Admin Dashboard**: Web interface for managing orders and shipping
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic shipping notifications with tracking info
- **Status Tracking**: Complete order lifecycle from payment to delivery

### 3. Metadata Structure

The new payment intent metadata includes:

```javascript
{
  // Customer Information
  customer_email: "customer@example.com",
  customer_name: "John Doe",
  customer_phone: "+1234567890",
  
  // Order Totals
  order_subtotal: "10000", // in cents
  order_shipping: "700",
  order_tax: "800",
  order_total: "11500",
  item_count: "2",
  
  // Individual Items (up to 3 items)
  item_1_id: "stealth-usb",
  item_1_name: "Stealth USB",
  item_1_quantity: "1",
  item_1_price: "100",
  
  // Shipping Address
  shipping_name: "John Doe",
  shipping_line1: "123 Main St",
  shipping_city: "Anytown",
  shipping_state: "CA",
  shipping_postal_code: "12345",
  shipping_country: "US",
  
  // Fulfillment Tracking
  fulfillment_status: "pending",
  order_date: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Existing Stripe variables
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# New variables for fulfillment system
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
ADMIN_API_KEY=your_secure_admin_key

# Email configuration for shipping notifications
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Stripe Dashboard Configuration

#### Enable Customer Receipts
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Customer emails
2. Enable "Successful payments" under Receipt emails
3. Customize the receipt template if desired

#### Setup Webhooks
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe-webhook`
3. Select events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Webhook Handler
- **Endpoint**: `/api/stripe-webhook`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Processes Stripe webhook events
- **Authentication**: Stripe signature verification

#### Admin Fulfillment API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/admin/fulfillment`
- **Methods**: GET (list orders), POST (update orders)
- **Authentication**: Admin API key in `X-Admin-Key` header

### 4. Admin Dashboard

#### Access
- Navigate to `/admin/fulfillment` in your application
- Enter the admin API key to authenticate

#### Features
- View orders filtered by fulfillment status
- Mark orders as processing, shipped, delivered, or cancelled
- Add tracking information when marking as shipped
- Automatic email notifications to customers

## Usage Examples

### Mark Order as Shipped (Programmatic)

```javascript
import { markOrderAsShipped } from './api/stripe-webhook.js';

const trackingInfo = {
  trackingNumber: '1Z999AA1234567890',
  carrier: 'UPS',
  trackingUrl: 'https://www.ups.com/track?tracknum=1Z999AA1234567890',
  estimatedDelivery: '2024-01-20'
};

const result = await markOrderAsShipped('pi_1234567890', trackingInfo);
console.log(result.message); // "Order marked as shipped and customer notified"
```

### Get Order Details

```javascript
import { getOrderById } from './api/admin/fulfillment.js';

const order = await getOrderById('pi_1234567890');
console.log(order.fulfillmentStatus); // "shipped"
console.log(order.tracking.number); // "1Z999AA1234567890"
```

## Fulfillment Status Flow

1. **pending** → Order created, payment not yet completed
2. **paid** → Payment successful, ready for processing
3. **processing** → Order being prepared for shipment
4. **shipped** → Order shipped with tracking information
5. **delivered** → Order confirmed delivered
6. **cancelled** → Order cancelled

## Email Templates

### Shipping Notification
Customers receive an HTML email when orders are marked as shipped, including:
- Order number and customer name
- Tracking number and carrier
- Estimated delivery date
- Tracking URL (if provided)
- Complete shipping address

### Stripe Receipts
Stripe automatically sends receipt emails when:
- Payment is successful
- `receipt_email` is set in payment intent
- Customer emails are enabled in Stripe dashboard

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin API Key**: Use a strong, unique key for admin access
2. **Webhook Signatures**: Always verify Stripe webhook signatures
3. **Email Credentials**: Use app-specific passwords for email services
4. **HTTPS**: Ensure all webhook endpoints use HTTPS
5. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control

## Troubleshooting

### Customer Not Receiving Receipts
1. Check `receipt_email` is set in payment intent
2. Verify customer emails are enabled in Stripe dashboard
3. Check customer's spam folder
4. Ensure email address is valid

### Webhook Not Processing
1. Verify webhook endpoint is accessible
2. Check webhook signing secret is correct
3. Review webhook logs in Stripe dashboard
4. Ensure proper event types are selected

### Admin Dashboard Access Issues
1. Verify admin API key is correct
2. Check network connectivity to API endpoints
3. Review browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure proper CORS configuration

## Future Enhancements

1. **Inventory Management**: Track product stock levels
2. **Return Processing**: Handle returns and refunds
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Order and revenue reporting
4. **Multi-carrier Integration**: Support for multiple shipping providers
5. **Customer Portal**: Allow customers to track their orders
6. **Automated Fulfillment**: Integration with fulfillment centers
